# Data Feminism - Summary

**Authors:** Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein
**Publisher:** MIT Press (2020)

Data Feminism presents a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics informed by intersectional feminist thought. The book outlines seven principles for doing data work that challenges power and works toward justice.

## Introduction: Why Data Science Needs Feminism

The introduction establishes the foundational argument for applying feminist perspectives to data science. The authors argue that data science, like all systems, reflects and reinforces existing inequalities, and that feminist theory provides essential tools for understanding and challenging these power dynamics.

- Data is never neutral or objective—it emerges from social, political, and historical contexts
- Intersectional feminism examines how systems of oppression (race, gender, class, ability) overlap
- The book draws heavily from Black feminist theory and scholars like Patricia Hill Collins

## Chapter 1: Examine Power

**Principle #1:** Examine how power operates in data systems.

The chapter introduces Patricia Hill Collins' "matrix of domination" framework and argues that those in dominant positions often lack the lived experience needed to identify bias in data systems.

- **Matrix of Domination**: Power operates in four domains—structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, and interpersonal
- **The Privilege Hazard**: Dominant group members lack the "empiricism of lived experience" to identify bias
- **Key examples**: Serena Williams' childbirth complications revealing maternal mortality disparities; facial recognition failing on dark-skinned faces; Amazon's hiring algorithm downgrading women's resumes
- **Missing data**: Mimi Onuoha's "Library of Missing Datasets" shows how power determines what gets measured

## Chapter 2: Challenge Power

**Principle #2:** Commit to challenging unequal power structures and working toward justice.

Moving beyond examination to action, this chapter outlines strategies for using data to resist oppression.

- **Four action strategies**: Collect (counterdata), Analyze (audit algorithms), Imagine (shift to co-liberation), Teach (diversify practitioners)
- **Key reframings**: Ethics → Justice; Bias → Oppression; Fairness → Equity; Accountability → Co-liberation
- **Key example**: DGEI Map (1971)—Black youth mapped traffic deaths, demonstrating community-led data collection
- **Warning**: Proof alone won't dismantle oppression; data can perpetuate deficit narratives if communities are reduced to problems

## Chapter 3: Elevate Emotion and Embodiment

**Principle #3:** Value multiple forms of knowledge, including emotion and embodied experience.

This chapter challenges the false binary between reason and emotion, arguing that "neutral" visualizations are actually rhetorical acts.

- **The "God Trick"**: Data visualization's false claim to show "everything from nowhere"—an impossible objective standpoint
- **Feminist Objectivity**: All knowledge is "situated"—produced by specific people in specific circumstances
- **Data Visceralization**: Making data experiential through multiple senses, engaging the whole body
- **Key examples**: Periscopic's gun violence visualization using "stolen years"; performance art revealing MoMA's gender disparities

## Chapter 4: "What Gets Counted Counts"

**Principle #4:** Rethink binaries and hierarchies in classification systems.

The chapter examines how counting and classification have historically been used to dominate, discipline, and exclude.

- Classification systems are culturally constructed and reflect societal values and biases
- The gender binary exemplifies how categories get encoded into technical systems (TSA scanners, Facebook, etc.)
- **Key question**: Whose interests are served by being counted, and who risks being harmed?
- **Key examples**: UK film industry study revealing 4:1 gender disparity in screenwriters; ProPublica's maternal mortality investigation
- Context and power analysis are essential when deciding whether, when, and how to count

## Chapter 5: Embrace Pluralism

**Principle #5:** Synthesize multiple perspectives, prioritizing local and Indigenous knowledge.

Complete knowledge emerges from multiple perspectives rather than singular "expert" voices.

- **Strangers in the Dataset**: Data scientists become problematic when disconnected from data origins
- **Problematic metaphors**: "Unicorn," "ninja," "wizard," "rock star" reinforce masculine individualism
- **Data cleaning myths**: "Tidy data" emphasis can erase contextual information and local knowledge
- **Data for Good vs. Co-liberation**: Co-liberation requires community leadership, data ownership, and capacity building
- **Key examples**: Anti-Eviction Mapping Project; Data Murals with community participation

---

## Chapter 6: The Numbers Don't Speak for Themselves

**Principle #6:** Consider context—data are products of unequal social relations.

Numbers require contextual interpretation; they are never raw or objective.

- Data emerge from complex circumstances shaped by power dynamics and collection incentives
- Power imbalances embed themselves in datasets (e.g., campus sexual assault underreporting)
- Chart framing matters: "White People Get More Services" vs. "People of Color Less Likely to Get Services"
- **Key examples**: FiveThirtyEight/GDELT case—GDELT measured media reports, not actual kidnappings; SAFElab incorporating community expertise
- **Solution**: "Data biographies" and datasheets to restore context

---

## Chapter 7: Show Your Work

**Principle #7:** Make labor visible—acknowledge the many hands behind data work.

Data science depends on labor that is often invisible, undervalued, and performed by women and people of color.

- **Invisible labor**: Hidden work that enables data products, following patterns of racial and gender oppression
- **Data supply chain**: Corporations benefit from obscuring human effort in data production
- **Reproductive vs. productive labor**: Unpaid "reproductive" work subsidizes paid "productive" work
- **Key examples**: Amazon Mechanical Turk workers earning below minimum wage; Google Books scanning workers lacking company amenities; Crawford & Joler's "Anatomy of an AI System"
- **Strategies**: Data production studies, documenting all contributors, feminist citation practices

## Conclusion: Now Let's Multiply

The conclusion emphasizes collective action and movement-building as essential to challenging power in data systems.

- **Worker power**: Tech workers have extraordinary bargaining power through proximity to infrastructure (e.g., Google Walkout)
- **Multi-strategy resistance**: Worker coalitions, design justice networks, civic tech, artistic interventions
- **Seven principles summarized**: Examine power, challenge power, elevate emotion, rethink binaries, embrace pluralism, consider context, make labor visible
- **Urgency**: "The best time for resistance and reimagination is before the norms and structures and regulations of the data economy have been fully determined"
- **Call to action**: "So now let's multiply. Let's multiply now."

4. **Rethink Binaries and Hierarchies** - Challenge classification systems
5. **Embrace Pluralism** - Synthesize multiple perspectives
6. **Consider Context** - Data are products of social relations
7. **Make Labor Visible** - Acknowledge all contributors to data work
